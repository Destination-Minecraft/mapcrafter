# mapcrafter #

by Moritz Hilscher

mapcrafter is a fast Minecraft World Renderer written in C++. It renders
Minecraft Worlds to a bunch of images which are viewable in any webbrowser
using Leaflet.

mapcrafter is free software and available under the GPL license.  You can
access the latest source code of mapcrafter on GitHub:
http://github.com/m0r13/mapcrafter

Thanks to pigmap and Minecraft Overviewer, whose documentations and source code
were very helpful. I also used the alpha blending code of pigmap and some maps
stuff of the template from Minecraft Overviewer.

## Documentation and Help ##

The documentation is in the `docs/` directory and you can build it yourself
with Sphinx. You can read a built version of the documentation
